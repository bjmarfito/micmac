\chapter{Graph library in MMVII}


%   ------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Introduction}

A  graph-libray (basic, for now) is available in \PPP.  The main objects that a user can
manipulate are, quite obviously: vertices, edges and graphs, the library
furnishes classes for those $3$ object, say $V,E,G$.
There also exist classes for algoritmic analyses (for example, the  shortest past).

To allow the user to associate any data they need with these object, the classes
are templatized by $3$ parameters defining the attributes of objects of the graph:

\begin{itemize}
      \item  class for attibute of vertices, denoted as $\AttrV$
      \item  class for attibute of oriented edges, denoted as $\AttrEOr$;
      \item  class for attibute of symetric (\emph{non} oriented) edges, denoted $\AttrESym$ (we will detail the difference
             between  $A_{\vec{e}}$ and  $A_{\overline{E}}$ in section~\ref{Gr:Attr:SymOr}).
\end{itemize}

When the user will create a graph $g$, they will specify the three types of attributes and create
an object of type $\ObjGr{G}$.  Then, when the user will create
vertices $v$ of $g$, these objects will be of type $\ObjGr{V}$;
similarly, the edges created and manipulated  will be of type $\ObjGr{E}$.

The code can be found in :

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt include/MMVII\_Tpl\_GraphStruct.h } for definition of structure for representing the graph;
    \item {\tt include/MMVII\_Tpl\_GraphAlgo\_SPCC.h } for basic graph algoritms : shortest path, minimum
          spaning tree and connected component.
\end{itemize}

Note that this is a "header only"  library, which is not the default choice in \PPP. However, providing a header-only library ensures its generality, thus it seemed an appropriate choice.

There also exists a file {\tt src/Graphs/BenchGraph.cpp} that contains (almost) extensive tests/benchmarks of the library.
It is densely commented, and it should serve as a detailed tutorial. Consequently, this chapter will be relatively
brief, and we invite users to deep-dive in the library by examining the file {\tt BenchGraph.cpp} .

\section{The graph structures}

%   ------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Creating objects}

Creating object is done in $3$ steps  :

\begin{itemize}
    \item  create a graph $g$ of type  $\ObjGr{G}$, this is done
           without any parameter;

    \item  create vertices  of $g$,  this is done by calling the method {\tt NewSom} of $g$,
          this method takes as parameter an attribute of type $\AttrV$;

    \item  create edges  of  $g$,  this is done by calling the method {\tt AddEdge} of $g$,
           if takes $5$  parameters :

    \begin{itemize}
          \item two vertices $v_1$ ans $v_2$  of type $\ObjGr{V}$;
          \item two oriented attributes of type $\AttrEOr$, one for edge $\GrEdgAB$
                and one for  $\GrEdgBA$
          \item one symetric attributes of type $\AttrESym$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%   ------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Attributes and object copy, destruction}

The three kinds of objects $G,V,E$ cannot be copied. When the user gets access
to vertices and edges  using methods of the libray, they always manipulate pointers or references
on them. 

For the destruction of objects, it is necessary and sufficient to destroy $G$, 
which will automatically destroy all the $V,E$ created.  Obviously,  user must never
explicitely destroy $V$ or $E$.

After the creation of $V$ and $E$, the object will contain attributes  of type $\AttrV$, $\AttrEOr$ and $\AttrESym$;
all these attributes will be copies of the value given by the user.


%   ------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Oriented and symetric attribute,}

\label{Gr:Attr:SymOr}

Algoritmic graph theory often distinguishes oriented from non-oriented graph.  In \PPP~ 
such distinction does not exist, and we do not use separate graphs types for it.  The same
graph can be considered as oriented or non-oriented. In practice, this distinction is made through 
the way the graph is used and through algorithms.

This is why we have two type of attribute for the edges : 

\begin{itemize}
   \item first, for each pair of connected vertices, there exist an edge  $\GrEdgAB$ and
         and an edge $\GrEdgBA$;

   \item the oriented attribute is \emph{physically} different for  $\GrEdgAB$
         and $\GrEdgBA$,  this is why we give $2$ values at creation;  if we
         modif the attribute of  $\GrEdgAB$, it will do nothing to  $\GrEdgBA$'s;

   \item conversely, the symetric attribute is   shared between the two edges, it exist
         \emph{physically} at a single location in memory,  and takes a single value at creation.
  
\end{itemize}

The distinction between oriented and non-oriented graphs will be done when runing algorithms and through their
parametrisation (see~\ref{Graph:Algo}). Typically, in the computation of the shortest path on a road network
with one way roads, the parametrisation will use $\AttrEOr$; while when computing the minimum spaning tree, 
the parametrization will use  $\AttrESym$.


%   ------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Acces to object}

We don't give all the details, but the main accesses offered by the library are :

\begin{itemize}
    \item for a graph, acces to its vertices;

    \item for a vertex $v_1$, access to its attributes, and all its adjacent edges
          (all the edges of type  $\GrEdgAB$);

    \item for a pair of vertices $v_1,v_2$, knowing if the edge $\GrEdgAB$ exist,
          and then the acces to it;

    \item for an edge, acces to its oriented and non oriented attributes, access to the vertex it is pointing to (i.e. $v_2$).
\end{itemize}

%$A_V,\vec{A}_e,\overline{A}_E$,


%   ------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Access to {\tt DirInit}}

Finally, to be complete, a tiny complex detail, when manipulating the symmetric
attribute of an edge $v_1v_2$, it may be interesting to know if the edge  was  created as $\GrEdgAB$
or $\GrEdgBA$. This is accessible via the method {\tt DirInit}.  See the (to
be written) section of graph on group, to see a concrete example.

\section{The basic algorithms}
\label{Graph:Algo}

%   ------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Parametrization of algorithms}

When graphs are used for representing data extracted from image analysis, for example a road
network in a satellite image, it often happens that we want to use the \emph{same} graph 
but in different variants, for example :

\begin{itemize}
    \item  consider only a subset of edges or vertices in connected components analysis;
    \item  consider different weighting for the shortest path computation.
\end{itemize}

To offer such flexibility, the algorithm of \PPP~ takes two kinds of parameters as object
deriving from base classes :

\begin{itemize}
    \item   {\tt cAlgo\_SubGr} parametrize a sub-graph, i.e. a subset of vertices and edges,
            this is done by the \emph{virtual} methods {\tt bool InsideVertex()} and {\tt bool InsideEdge()};
            default methods return always {\tt true};

    \item   {\tt cAlgo\_ParamVG} parametrize a weighted graph, this is done by  \emph{virtual} method
            {\tt tREAL8 WeightEdge()}, default methods return always {\tt 1.0} ;
            also {\tt cAlgo\_ParamVG} inherits from  {\tt cAlgo\_SubGr}.
\end{itemize}

For example, the method {\tt ShortestPath\_A2B}, from class {\tt cAlgoSP}, that compute the shortest path
between two vertices, takes as fourth parameter an object of type {\tt const cAlgo\_ParamVG \&}.


%   ------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Connected component algorithms}

The class {\tt cAlgoCC} computes the connected component of a graph. It offers $3$ public services :

\begin{itemize}
    \item computation of the connected component of a single vertex, returns the component as vector of vertices;

    \item computation of the connected components of a set of vertice, returns the components as list of vector of vertices;

    \item computation of all the connected components of the graph, just a special case of previous one.
\end{itemize}

The $3$ methods take as last paramater an object of type {\tt const cAlgo\_SubGr \&}.


%   ------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Mininum spaning tree, forest and shortest paths}

\subsubsection{class {\tt cAlgoSP}}

The class {\tt cAlgoSP} allows to compute the mininum spaning tree, forest and the shortest paths.
All three are done by the same class because algorithmically building a minimum spaning tree
is very close to building the tree of shortest path. 
The only difference is the agregation of cost; for curious readers, see the
method {\tt Internal\_MakeShortestPathGen} and observe there is only one extra 
line of code for the minimum spaning tree, this line is tagged by comment {\tt  @DIF:SP:MST} .


\subsubsection{Methods for shortest path}

There  exist  $2$ public methods for computing the shortest path :

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt ShortestPath\_A2B} the simpler and most common case,
          compute the shortest path between $2$ vertices,

    \item {\tt MakeShortestPathGen} compute the shortest path between $2$ sets of vertices.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Methods for minimum spaning}

There exist $3$ methods for minimum spaning tree/forest :

\begin{itemize}
   \item {\tt MinimumSpanninTree} returns the minimum spaning tree containing a single vertex;

   \item {\tt MinimumSpanningForest} returns the minimum spaning forest of a set of vertices;

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Acces to results}

While doing the computation, the algorithm writes some fields inside the vertices.
This value written can be of interest :

\begin{itemize}
   \item  the method {\tt AlgoCost()}  allows to know the tree/path cost
   \item  the method {\tt BackTrackFathersPath}()  allows to extract the shortest path
          by back-tracking  the trees that were previously built.
\end{itemize}

Not very clear \dots and to complete by adding a way to memorize the vertices that have been reached.
